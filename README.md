# Calculator
This was my fifth TOP project, it requires a good understanding of HTML/CSS/JS basics in general.

This time I wanted to make this project special and different from the other projects, and I really think that I did a good job in terms of making it unique.

Alhamdulillah

# What was needed to complete that project:
1. Problem-Solving skills
2. Patience 
3. Good CSS Flexbox and Grid manipulation skills
4. Dealing with JS Event Listeners, Conditionals, string and array methods,Functions and more...

# Challenges that I've overcame: 
1. Making the calculator smart and responsive by using a lot of conditionals to prevent errors 
2. Organizing the calculator screen div to avoid overflow issues
